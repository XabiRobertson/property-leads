# Boise Ada County Solar Property Leads

This project contains a curated and scored list of **high-value residential properties** in **Boise, Idaho (Ada County)** ideal for solar installation outreach. These leads have been filtered and scored using zoning, property value, and lot size to highlight the most solar-relevant homes in the region.

## 🔍 What’s Included

Each lead contains the following fields:

- Parcel ID  
- Address  
- ZIP Code  
- Zoning Type  
- Property Value  
- Lot Size (Acreage)  
- Subdivision  
- Score (0–15)

## 🧠 Scoring System

Leads are scored from **0 to 15** based on two key factors:

- **Assessed Property Value** (higher = better)
- **Lot Size in Acres** (larger = better)

Only leads with a **score of 15** (our highest tier) are included in the premium CSV offering. These are top-tier prospects ideal for solar panel installations — high home equity, larger properties, and correct residential zoning.
